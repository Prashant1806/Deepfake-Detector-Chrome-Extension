Deep Fake Detector Chrome Extension
This is a Chrome extension that uses the Sightengine API to detect deep fake videos and audio on the active tab, and displays a warning popup if any deep fake content is found.

Installation
To install the extension, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your computer.
Open Google Chrome and go to the "Extensions" page (chrome://extensions/).
Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner of the page.
Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the page.
Select the directory containing the downloaded repository files.
The extension should now be installed and active in your browser.

Usage
To use the extension, simply browse the web as usual. Whenever you open a tab with a video or audio element, the extension will automatically check the content for deep fake patterns using the Sightengine API. If any deep fake content is found, a warning popup will be displayed.
